# Welcome to Eleanor's's Cupcake website
### This is a test website for a business soon to be located in Ventura Ca.


This is a simple static website created using:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* PHP (and the PHPMAILER Library);

This is the first website I ever created by myself from the top down.
It was an excellent experience that taught me a lot about HTML and CSS and responsive design.

Unfortunately, I have not been unable to get the PHP script to send an email when the form is filled out.
There is an issue with gmail and authentication.
I will try to use a different mail service (protonmail) in the future.



The map was created using [openlayers](https://openlayers.org).
The contact form uses [PHPMAILER](https://github.com/PHPMailer) to send emails.
